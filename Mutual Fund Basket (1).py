# The comparison between the risk (volatility) and expected ROI for mutual fund companies (in blue) and growth rate companies (in green) shows a clear trade-off. Mutual fund companies offer lower volatility, meaning they are less risky, but also provide lower expected returns. In contrast, growth rate companies demonstrate higher volatility, indicating more risk, but they offer much higher potential returns, especially companies like Bajaj Auto and Bajaj Finserv. This highlights a common investment dilemma: lower risk comes with a lower reward, while higher risk could yield higher returns.
# 
# For long-term investments, the goal is typically to find companies that offer a balance of stable returns and manageable risk. The companies in our mutual fund exhibit low volatility, meaning they are less risky, and their moderate returns make them solid choices for long-term, stable growth. They are well-suited for conservative investors who want steady returns without significant fluctuations in value.

# Calculating Expected Returns
# 

# Assumptions:
# 
# Assume the person is investing 5000 rupees every month.
# Use the expected ROI from the mutual fund companies to simulate the growth over time.
# Compute the compounded value of the investments for each period (1y, 3y, 5y, and 10y).
# Visualize the accumulated value over these periods.
